    <h1>Karage Donburi</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Karage donburi is an excellent japanese main dish consisting of tiny bite sized chunks of fried chicken laid over a bed of rice. The name "Donburi" is japanese for rice bowl
        and "karage" for fried chicken. Most japanese donburis come with a topping of sea weed and/or red cabbage with a drizzle of spicy japanese mayo on top.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken</strong>

                <li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and toss to coat. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>

                <li>Carefully fry the coated chicken pieces in batches until they are golden brown and cooked through, about 4-5 minutes per batch. Place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>

                <li>Scatter your choice of seaweed, sliced green onions, shredded lettuce or cabbage if desired.</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
        </li>

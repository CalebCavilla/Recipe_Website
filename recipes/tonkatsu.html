    <h1>Tonkatsu</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tonkatsu is a more western style dish that features breaded deep-fried pork cutlets. Although not typically eaten as a main dish, Tonkatsu can be eaten by-itself or
        in combination with rice or another side dish. Similar to tempura, Tonkatsu is almost always eaten with a signature dipping sauce, which will also be included in 
        this recipe guide.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>All-purpose flour, for dredging</li>
            <li>1-2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>Panko breadcrumbs (any breadcrumb will likely do)</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for deep frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For Serving:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Shredded cabbage</li>
            <li>Tonkatsu sauce (available at Japanese grocery stores or homemade)</li>
            <li>Cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the Pork Cutlets</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a meat mallet to gently pound the pork cutlets to an even thickness, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>
                <li>Season both sides of the pork with salt and pepper.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Coating Process</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Dredge each pork cutlet in flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
                <li>Dip the cutlets into the beaten egg, allowing excess egg to drip off.</li>
                <li>Coat the cutlets with panko breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Cutlets</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Carefully place the coated pork cutlets into the hot oil, one at a time.</li>
                <li>Fry until the tonkatsu turns golden brown and crispy on both sides, about 4-5 minutes per side. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain the temperature..</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Rest</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a slotted spoon or a wire mesh strainer to remove the fried tonkatsu from the oil. Place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
                <li>Allow the tonkatsu to rest for a couple of minutes. This helps the breading set and keeps the meat juicy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Slice and Serve</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Slice the tonkatsu into strips or pieces. Serve them on a plate alongside shredded cabbage and rice.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve with Tonkatsu Sauce</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Drizzle tonkatsu sauce over the tonkatsu slices or serve it on the side for dipping.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Enjoy your tonkatsu with the crispiness of the breading, the tenderness of the pork, and the refreshing taste of the shredded cabbage.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

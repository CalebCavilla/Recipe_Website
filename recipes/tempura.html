    <h1>Tempura!</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tempura is a delicious japanese side dish typically consisting of deep fried seafood. Although the "seafood" is most commonly shrimp, any other type of fish
        or ocean dwelling creature could be used and it would still be considered tempura. Tempura is almost always served with a side of cooked vegetables and dipping sauce.

        </ul>
        <h4>For Frying</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegetable oil (canola or sunflower oil), for deep frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For Dipping Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dashi stock (or water)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)</li>
            <li>Grated daikon radish (for garnish)</li>
            <li>Grated ginger (for garnish)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dipping Sauce</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, dashi stock (or water), and mirin. Mix well and set aside. You can adjust the proportions to suit your taste.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the ingredients</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If using shrimp, peel and devein them, leaving the tails intact. Make a few shallow cuts on the underside of the shrimp to prevent curling during frying.</li>
                <li>Cut vegetables and seafood into manageable pieces, ensuring they are dry before dipping in batter.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Make the Tempura Batter</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine chilled flour, chilled egg, and ice water. Mix gently with chopsticks or a fork. 
                    Do not overmix; it's okay if the batter is a bit lumpy. The batter should be thin and somewhat runny.</li>
                <li>Place ice cubes in a larger bowl and place the batter bowl on top to keep it chilled during the frying process.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a deep pot or a frying pan, heat vegetable oil to around 170-180°C (340-360°F). Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Dip and Fry</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Dip the prepared ingredients into the tempura batter one by one. Let any excess batter drip off before carefully placing them into the hot oil.</li>
                <li>Fry the items in small batches to prevent overcrowding. Fry until the tempura turns golden brown and crispy, about 2-4 minutes depending on the ingredient.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Serve</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a slotted spoon or a wire mesh strainer to remove the fried tempura from the oil. Place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Arrange the tempura on a serving plate. Serve with the dipping sauce, grated daikon radish, and grated ginger on the side.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Dip the crispy tempura into the dipping sauce and savor the delicious contrast of textures and flavors.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

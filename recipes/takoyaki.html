    <h1>Takoyaki</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Also known as "grilled octopus balls", Takoyaki are a staple of modern japanese street food. Serving as an excellent snack to be eaten by itself,
        or along side another meal. As the name implies, takoyaki are little round octopus balls which are battered and fried, then served with a drizzle
        of spicy mayo and whatever seasoning one might desire.

            <li>1/2 tsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the filling and toppings:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup cooked and diced octopus</li>
            <li>Green onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Tenkasu (tempura scraps)</li>
            <li>Aonori (green seaweed flakes)</li>

            <li>Spicy mayo</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the batter</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour and dashi (or water) until you get a smooth batter.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs, soy sauce, and salt to the batter. Mix well until combined. The batter should have a slightly thick consistency.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the ingredients</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Dice the cooked octopus into small pieces.</li>
                <li>Finely chop the green onions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Takoyaki pan</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat the takoyaki pan on medium heat. Add a little oil into each well of the pan.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Wells</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the pan is hot, pour the batter into the wells, filling them almost to the top.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Add the Fillings (the good part :D)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Place a piece of diced octopus into each well of the batter.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle chopped green onions and tenkasu over each well.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook and Shape the balls</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>As the batter starts to cook and set on the bottom, use a skewer or chopsticks to start turning the takoyaki balls. 
                    The idea is to rotate them as they cook to form a round shape. The half-cooked batter on the sides will start to flow 
                    into the center, creating the ball shape.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Plate</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the takoyaki balls are golden brown and cooked through (about 5-7 minutes), transfer them to a plate.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Drizzle takoyaki sauce and Japanese mayonnaise over the cooked takoyaki.
                    Sprinkle bonito flakes and aonori on top.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Serve the takoyaki immediately while they're still hot and crispy. Use toothpicks or skewers to pick them up and enjoy!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
